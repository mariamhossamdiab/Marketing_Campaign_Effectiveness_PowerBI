# Marketing_Campaign_Effectiveness_PowerBI
Anjum Hotel has been running various marketing campaigns to increase room bookings and enhance brand visibility.
Despite investing significantly in these campaigns,

and which campaign strategies are most effective. 
They want to optimize their marketing spend and maximize bookings and revenue.
